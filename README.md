The brief for this project was to create a React application that allows users to search for space-related images based on queries

## Built with

## Instructions

Once you've cloned the repo, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run <b>npm start</b> to create an instance of the app in your browser

I would add animation to the loading message and image gallery as well as further css rules for different mobile device sizes.
